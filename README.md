# Safer-Driver
Porto Seguro is the third largest insurance company in Brazil. In this competition, we will build a model that predicts the probability that a driver will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year. 
A more accurate prediction will allow them to further tailor their prices, and hopefully make auto insurance coverage more accessible to more drivers.
The result is evaluated using the Normalized Gini Coefficient.
